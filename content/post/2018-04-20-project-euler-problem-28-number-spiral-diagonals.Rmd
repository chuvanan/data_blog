Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5
by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

**21** 22 23 24 **25**

20 **7** 8 **9** 10

19 6 **1** 2 11

18 **5** 4 **3** 12

**17** 16 15 14 **13**

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.  What is
the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the
same way?

There is a pattern of the numbers on the diagonals if I represent the spiral as
a straight vector:


**1**

2 **3** 4 **5** 6 **7** 8 **9**

10 11 12 **13** 14 15 16 **17** 18 19 20 **21** 22 23 24 **25**

The step of each row is 2, 4, 6..., and the number of row is (n-1)/2. Using this
information we can contruct the index of the diagonals of the spiral 1:(n*n).


```{r}
sum_spiral_diag <- function(n) {
    stopifnot(n %% 2 != 0)
    if (n > 1e5) stop("n too big")
    s <- 1:(n*n)
    i <- seq(2, length.out = (n-1)/2, by = 2)
    i <- rep(i, each = 4)
    i <- cumsum(c(1, i))
    sum(as.numeric(s[i]))
}

sum_spiral_diag(1001)
```
