I've just stumbled upon this [post](https://www.miskatonic.org/2014/10/17/prettifying-r-in-emacs/)
by William Denton, and quickly wondered how I could have missed Emacs's feature
`prettify-symbols-mode` which had been released more than three years ago.

Some operators (`%>%`, `<-`, `->`) in R wasn't very eyepleasing, especially in
Emacs, so I added this to my Emacs config:

```lisp
(when (boundp 'global-prettify-symbols-mode)
  (add-hook 'ess-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (push '("%>%" . ?→) prettify-symbols-alist)
              ))
  (add-hook 'inferior-ess-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (push '("%>%" . ?→) prettify-symbols-alist)
              ))
  (global-prettify-symbols-mode +1))
```

Here's the result, looking much neater.

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/post/img/2018-04-04-pretty-fonts-for-r/pretty_code.png")
```

For RStudio users, you might want to try out `Fira Code` or `Hasklig` - they are
code fonts with monospaced ligatures.
