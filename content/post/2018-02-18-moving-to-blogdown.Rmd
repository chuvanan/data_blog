I have used several blogging plattforms over the years, but none of them made me
satisfied. The most recent one is jekyll which is good for most of my demands
but it's somewhat buggy. And I hate dealing with Ruby's dependencies.


I've now moved to `blogdown`, a new platform for static site blogging created by
Yihui Xie - author of the some popular R packages: `knitr`, `bookdown`, etc.


I've heard about this project since its early days and my first impression was
pretty good. `blogdown` is now mature, it's time for me.
