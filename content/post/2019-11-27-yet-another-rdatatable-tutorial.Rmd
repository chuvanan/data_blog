I just wrote a small (cookbook-style) [tutorial](https://github.com/chuvanan/rdatatable-cookbook)
about using [`data.table`](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) package
to analyse real-world data. This project is my appreciation of the package which
[Dirk](https://twitter.com/eddelbuettel/status/1197220691449397249) says it all:
"there is so much power and beauty in `dt[i, j, by]` and the @rdatatable backend".
