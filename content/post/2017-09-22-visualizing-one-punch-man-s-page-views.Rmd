I am a long-time [One-punch Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-Punch_Man)
fanboy.  In case you didn't know, it is a Japanese superhero webcomic - a type
of comic book that published online. Though I am not a regular reader of this
genre, this action-comedy book really got my addiction.

I first read this comic strip in late 2012 when its debut chapter in Vietnamese
released on manag24h.com and have kept up with the series from then on.

The book features Saitama, an ordinary man turned into a superhero, who is known
for his incredible strength, in fact, he can easily defeat any monsters with a
single punch.

It is ironic that he is so extremely overpowered that he is no longer able to
gain any thrill of battling and has become quite bored. In the words of
psychological terminology, Saitama is facing a self-imposed existential crisis
:). So the series is a funny story depicting his search of heroic deeds. If you
are curious, you can give it a try [here](http://truyentranhtuan.com/onepunch-man/).

Like many other popular anime series, namely One Piece, Naruto, etc. One-punch
Man is characterized with weeks long release cycle. Four years has passed, the
webcomis has published only 114 chapters. I wonder how many readers who are
still following the series. As a little experiment, I write a scrapping script
in R to collect the webcomic's realease dates as well as page-views by chapter
and visualise the trend of readership over the course of the series.
