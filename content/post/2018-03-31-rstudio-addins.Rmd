I'm going to build an add-in for my team to view and deploy R scripts/reports
from/to remote server.

Here's a couple of sources for doing research.

Official documentation:

* https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/

* http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/gadgets.html

* http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/gadget-ui.html

* https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/understanding-add-ins/

* https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/Shiny-Gadgets-Interactive-tools-for-Programming-and-Data-Analysis

Learning more about `rstudioapi` will also be helpful:

* https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rstudioapi/index.html

Cool things other people did:
