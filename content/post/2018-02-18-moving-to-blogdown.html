<p>I have used several blogging plattforms over the years, but none of them made me satisfied. The most recent one is jekyll which is good for most of my demands but it’s somewhat buggy. And I hate dealing with Ruby’s dependencies.</p>
<p>I’ve now moved to <code>blogdown</code>, a new platform for static site blogging created by Yihui Xie - author of the some popular R packages: <code>knitr</code>, <code>bookdown</code>, etc.</p>
<p>I’ve heard about this project since its early days and my first impression was pretty good. <code>blogdown</code> is now mature, it’s time for me.</p>
