I came across this
[post](https://rickpackblog.wordpress.com/2018/04/25/openxlsx-r-pkg-column-width-setting-when-auto-not-sufficient/)
while reading [rweekly.org](https://rweekly.org/). Our team at RTA also used
[openxlsx](https://github.com/awalker89/openxlsx) as core engine for exporting
data in Excel format from a shiny app. IMHO, this is one of the best R packages
for creating `.xlsx` files, which achieves both performance and friendly user
interface.

Regarding the question on
[SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45860085/r-autofit-excel-column-width/50006932#50006932)
about autofit Excel column width. I had a slightly different version than Rick
Pack's implementation. I think Rick's use of `pmax()` is a bit more elegant than
`mapply()` while our's function `count_char()` is nicer than `apply()`.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
set_column_widths <- function(wb, sheet, x) {
    count_char <- function(s) sapply(s, function(x) {
        x <- as.character(x)
        x[is.na(x)] <- ""
        max(nchar(x), na.rm = TRUE)
    })
    cols_width <- count_char(x)
    colnames_width <- count_char(names(x))
    cols_width <- mapply(max, cols_width, colnames_width,
                         MoreArgs = list(na.rm = TRUE))
    openxlsx::setColWidths(wb = wb, sheet = sheet,
                           cols = seq_along(cols_width),
                           widths = cols_width)
}
```
