As an Emacs ESS
[lover](https://anchu.rbind.io/2017/10/05/learning-to-love-emacs/), I really
push the idea of Miles McBain. He aims to gather [ESS
configurations](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/esscss) contributed by
[#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats) community members so that new
ESS users can onboard easily.

I still remember my early days trying to turn Emacs into a fully functional IDE
for R programming as a replacement for RStudio. I did have to search for a lot
of Emacs init files, just to find out about functionalities equivalent to
RStudo's ones, namely the Knit button, syntax highlighting for RMarkdown
document, etc.

The fact is that, while ESS is a great package for coding R (and other
statistical languages), it's not yet a friendly environment to beginners. This
is, indirectly, [said](http://ess.r-project.org/) by ESS's authors:

> _Although all users of these statistical analysis programs are welcome to
> apply ESS, advanced users or professionals who regularly work with text-based
> statistical analysis scripts, with various statistical languages/programs, or
> with different operating systems might benefit from it the most._


PS: Guess who made that first PR?
