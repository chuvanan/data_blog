From the Flowing Data [blog](https://flowingdata.com/2019/02/12/egot-winner-timelines/),
EGOT winners are those who have won all four prestigious prizes including Emmy,
Grammy, Oscar and Tony.

Only 15 people have made it. And I was surprised that Robert Lopez, the youngest
and the quickest to win all four, is the composer of the songs featued in films
Frozen and Coco.
